## Introduction

This project is to assess the skills of a beginner Python developer and help facilitate the necessary notes required to move on to a more challenging exercise and more difficult concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before contributing to the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python (3.11.4 or above)

## Setup Instructions

To set up the the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sandmanscanga/PythonBeginnerAssessment.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd PythonBeginnerAssessment
    ```

3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. Install project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Code Style and Guidelines

I adhere to the [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for our Python code. Please ensure that your code follows PEP 8 guidelines. Use meaningful variable and function names, add docstring to functions and modules, and write descriptive comments where necessary.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to the project:

1. **Code Contributions:** Improve the library by fixing bugs, adding new functions, or enhancing existing modules.

3. **Report Bugs:** If you discover any issues or bugs, please report them on the issue tracker.

4. **Feature Requests:** Suggest new features or improvements that you'd like to see in the project.

## Issue Tracker

If you encounter any bugs, have questions, or want to suggest new features, please use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/sandmanscanga/PythonBeginnerAssessment/issues) to create an issue. Be sure to include detailed steps to reproduce the problem and any relevant error messages.

## Pull Requests

When you're ready to submit your contribution, follow these steps:

1. Fork the project repository.

2. Create a new branch for your contribution:

    git commit -m "Added feature X"
    ```

4. Push your changes to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

5. Open a pull request against the `main` branch of the original repository.

## Code Review Process

All contributions undergo a code review process. Please be patient during this process, as it may take some time. Feedback will be provided, and you may need to make some changes before your contribution is accepted.

## Testing

I have a comprehensive test suite in place for the project. Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that your code passes all tests, and consider adding relevant tests for new functions or modules.
